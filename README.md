NutriDzair is a personalized nutrition recommendation web app tailored for Algerian users. It helps individuals make healthy, budget-friendly food choices by considering key dietary constraints such as:

✅ Budget limitations

🔥 Calorie requirements (e.g., weight loss, maintenance, gain)

🥦 Dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, low-carb, high-protein)

⚠️ Food allergies (e.g., gluten, nuts, dairy)

🧪 Nutritional goals (e.g., iron-rich, low-sugar, high-fiber)

The app intelligently recommends meals using informed search algorithms (like A* and Uniform Cost Search), balancing nutrition, taste, cost, and user preferences.
