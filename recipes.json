Stir to coat with curry paste and cook until tofu releases its moisture and starts to look drier, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in soy sauce and vinegar. Stir in garlic, zucchini, and broccoli.\nMix everything in the saucepan well and cook until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. If vegetables are not releasing enough moisture, add a splash of vegetable stock to prevent sticking too much; keep the heat medium to medium-high.\nOnce everything is yellow-tinged from the paste and your kitchen smells amazing, the vegetables should be looking brighter but not overcooked, and the pot should be making a high sizzling sound. Pour in vegetable stock and coconut cream. Mix, scraping the bottom to bring up any flavor bits, and lower heat. Only cover the saucepan if the amount of liquid looks very little compared to vegetables and tofu. Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, checking every few minutes because it shouldn't take long from this point to warm through and meld flavors.\nMeanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet and add about 1/2 cup cauliflower rice, enough for 1 serving, in a thin layer. Cook until tender, about 2 minutes or longer, depending on your texture preference. Cook remaining cauliflower rice in batches depending on how many people are eating.\nCheck in on the curry and season with salt and pepper to taste. Curry texture should be thick and creamy and should taste a little tangy, a little coconutty, and have that aromatic kick characteristic of yellow curry. If the curry paste isn't shining through as much as you'd like, add a little glob of it and stir to dissolve. If you want more umami, add a little splash of soy sauce. If you want it more yellow, a pinch of turmeric powder can give it that brighter color.\nAdd 1/2 cup of cauliflower rice to a bowl and squeeze 1/2 a lime on top. Top with yellow curry.",

Rub the top of each chicken breast with olive oil, place seam-side down in the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from oven, tent loosely with foil, and allow to cool for about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and garlic and cook until mushrooms start to brown, about 4 minutes. Add thyme leaves and white vinegar, stirring and deglazing the skillet, and cook for 2 minutes.\nReduce heat to medium-low and stir in the heavy cream, salt, and pepper. Cook until sauce starts to slightly thicken. Add 1/2 cup Asiago cheese and stir until melted and smooth. Remove from heat immediately; overcooking the Asiago cheese will create a lumpy, stringy sauce.\nSlice each chicken breast into 1/2-inch thick slices, and drizzle with Asiago sauce. Garnish with thyme and serve immediately.",

Drain rice without rinsing.\nCrush saffron threads to a powder in a small mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl with 2 tablespoons boiling water. Stir, cover, and set saffron water aside.\nFill a 5-quart nonstick pot with 9 cups water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons salt and stir until dissolved. Break roasted noodles into thirds and add to boiling water with rice. Stir once gently, and watch carefully as it cooks so water does not boil over. Taste water for salt and adjust accordingly. Cook until first rice grain pops up to the surface. Set a timer for 4 minutes and cook, scooping off any foam from the surface until the timer goes off. Test rice and continue to cook until tender on the outside but still firm to the bite on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes more.\nDrain rice and noodles in a colander and rinse quickly with lukewarm water and a spray faucet to rinse off extra starch. Taste and gently rinse again if too salty. Set aside to drain completely. Wash and dry the pot.\nPlace the clean pot over medium heat. Add oil, 1 tablespoon saffron water, and a pinch of salt; swirl the pot until the bottom and lower sides are coated with the oil mixture. Tightly overlap potato slices in a single layer covering the bottom of the pot to create the tahdig layer.\nGently scatter rice-noodle mixture over the tahdig in a pyramid shape, making sure potatoes are completely covered and moving noodles away from the sides of the pot. Gently poke the handle of a wooden spoon into rice and noodles a few times, being careful not to hit tahdig; this will allow steam to escape while cooking. Cover and cook until you see steam escaping from the sides of the lid and tahdig starts to set, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, combine 1/4 cup boiling water with 2 tablespoons melted butter and remaining saffron water. Lay a kitchen towel out on a heatproof surface.\nTest tahdig by quickly tapping the side of the pot with a wooden spoon. When the pot sizzles, remove it from the heat. Remove the lid and place it on the kitchen towel, being careful that none of the condensation drips into the pot. Wrap the towel around the lid and secure the ends at the top by the handle so they will not hang near the heat source. Drizzle butter mixture over rice and cover with the towel-wrapped lid.\nPlace a heat diffuser on a burner over low or medium-low heat and return the pot to the stove. Cook until crispy, rotating the pot a few times, about 35 minutes. Remove from the heat and place on a damp kitchen towel; let sit, uncovered, for 5 minutes so tahdig will release easily.\nMeanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small pan over medium heat. Add dates, raisins, and cinnamon; sprinkle with a little salt. Cook and stir until dates are glistening and soft, 3 to 5 minutes.\nGently scatter rice on a platter and remove potato tahdig pieces and serve on the side. Sprinkle raisin-date sauce over top.",

Drain rice without rinsing.\nCrush saffron threads to a powder in a small mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl with 2 tablespoons boiling water. Stir, cover, and set saffron water aside.\nFill a 5-quart nonstick pot with 12 cups water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 4 tablespoons salt and stir until dissolved. Add rice, stir once gently, and watch carefully as it cooks so water does not boil over. Taste for salt and add more if needed. Cook rice until the first piece pops up to the surface. Set a timer for 4 minutes and cook, scooping off any foam from the surface, until the timer goes off. Test rice and continue to cook until tender on the outside but still firm to the bite on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes more.\nDrain rice in a colander and rinse quickly with lukewarm water and a spray faucet to rinse off extra starch. Taste rice and gently rinse again if too salty. Set aside to drain completely. Wash and dry the pot.\nCombine parsley, cilantro, fresh dill, chives, and dried dill in a large bowl. Gently stir in rice, taking care not to break grains.\nPlace the clean pot over medium heat. Add oil, 1 tablespoon saffron water, and a pinch of salt; swirl the pot until the bottom and lower sides are coated with oil mixture. Trim or tear lavash bread and cover the bottom of the pot to create the tahdig layer.\nGently scatter rice-herb mixture over the tahdig in a pyramid shape, making sure lavash is completely covered. Place garlic stalks on top at the outer edges of rice. Gently poke the handle of a wooden spoon into rice a few times, being careful not to hit the tahdig; this will allow steam to escape while cooking. Cover and cook until you see steam escaping from the sides of the lid and the tahdig starts to set, 10 to 13 minutes.\nMeanwhile, combine 1/4 cup boiling water, melted butter, and remaining saffron water in a small bowl. Lay a kitchen towel out on a heatproof surface.\nTest the tahdig by quickly tapping the side of the pot with a wooden spoon. When it sizzles, remove the pot from heat. Remove the lid and place it on the kitchen towel, being careful that none of the condensation drips into the pot. Wrap the towel around the lid and secure the ends at the top by the handle so they will not hang near the heat source. Drizzle butter mixture over rice and cover with the towel-wrapped lid.\nPlace a heat diffuser on a burner over low or medium-low heat and return the pot to the stove. Cook until crispy, rotating the pot a few times, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat and place on a damp kitchen towel; let sit, uncovered, for 5 minutes so the tahdig will release easily.\nServe rice on a platter, garnish with garlic stalks, and remove the tahdig whole or in pieces and serve on the side.

Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\nFor the filling, slice pumpkin into 8 pieces. Discard seeds. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and cover with another sheet of foil to create a steaming pouch.\nCook pumpkin in the preheated oven until tender, about 30 minutes.

Add egg, salt, and pepper to taste. Beat until well combined. Set aside.\nAssemble the ravioli by lightly flouring a work surface. Remove dough from the refrigerator and divide into 8 equal portions. Shape each portion into an oval-shaped flat disc. Run each disc through a pasta roller according to manufacturer's instructions until it reaches the desired thickness; you should have 8 long sheets of pasta. Lightly dust each sheet with flour.\nPlace one sheet of pasta on a work surface. Drop tablespoonfuls of filling evenly down the length of sheet leaving enough room to seal dough around filling. Lay a second sheet of pasta on top. Use your fingers to press down and seal pasta around filling. Cut ravioli with a pasta cutter or round glass. Repeat with remaining sheets of pasta and filling.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook ravioli in batches until tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes per batch.\nMeanwhile, to make sauce, heat butter and sage in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently, until butter is light brown and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Be careful not to burn it. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add cooked ravioli to sauce and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.",

Beat in eggs one at a time, thoroughly mixing after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract.\nMix 1/3 of the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just combined. Mix in 1/2 of the coffee and 1/2 of the sour cream until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture alternately with remaining sour cream and coffee. Do not overmix. Fill the prepared cupcake cups evenly with batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until they spring back lightly when touched, 18 to 22 minutes. Let cool completely, 30 minutes to 1 hour.\nCore cooled cupcakes using a knife or cupcake corer, cutting about halfway down. Save cupcake centers for another use (such as for making a batch of cake balls).\nPrepare ganache. Add white chocolate chips and heavy cream to a large, microwave-safe bowl. Heat at 50% power until chocolate is melted and smooth, in 30-second intervals, stirring after each. Mix in crushed candies and peppermint extract until thoroughly combined. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, stirring often.\nPlace ganache in a piping bag or resealable plastic bag with a corner cut off. Fill each cupcake to the top with ganache. Allow them to sit until ganache firms up and doesn't \"smudge\" when pressed lightly with fingertips, 15 to 20 minutes.\nPrepare frosting. Cream butter until smooth in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in 1 cup powdered sugar at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract, peppermint extract, and salt. Add heavy cream and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. If frosting is too thick, add more heavy cream--or if it is too thin, add more powdered sugar until frosting is a spreadable consistency that still holds its shape.\nPlace a small amount of frosting in a separate bowl and add yellow food coloring for the ear muffs. Divide remaining frosting in half. To 1/2 of the divided frosting, add cocoa powder and red food coloring to achieve an auburn color. Divide remaining white frosting in half again. Color 1/2 peach using a very light amount of red and yellow food coloring. Color remaining frosting red. Put each into a piping bag fitted with a coupler.\nArrange cupcakes on a large cake board or serving platter, starting from the top. Begin with 1 cupcake at the top. Follow with a row of 2 cupcakes, making sure they stay as close as possible. (If cupcakes slide around, affix a small amount of frosting to the bottom of them so they stick to the serving platter or cake board.) Follow with a row of 3 cupcakes, then a row of 5 cupcakes, a row of 4 cupcakes, another row of 5 cupcakes, and finally a last row of 4 cupcakes. Make sure the cupcakes are as close to one another as possible. If there are any large gaps, you can use large marshmallows, trimmed to fit, in order to fill them in and make a flatter, more cohesive surface to frost.\nBeginning with the top 6 cupcakes (the rows with 1 cupcake, 2 cupcakes, and 3 cupcakes in them), frost the hat portion of the cake using the red frosting and large round tip. Smooth center portion using an offset spatula, if desired. Use the peach frosting to frost the center 3 cupcakes in the row of 5 below the hat, leaving a cupcake on each side unfrosted for the ear muffs. Smooth with an offset spatula. Affix 2 dark chocolate chips upside-down for the eyes in the center of the peach frosting.\nPipe the nose below the eyes, and then the lower lip below the nose using the peach frosting. Frost the cupcakes on each side of the face with the yellow frosting for the ear muffs. To frost the beard, use the auburn colored frosting and cover the remaining unfrosted cupcakes (that contain a row of 4, a row of 5, and final row of 4 cupcakes) with a thin layer of the auburn frosting. Smooth frosting all over the \"beard-portion\" of the cupcakes until mostly smooth and flat. Place a star tip on the auburn frosting piping bag, and pipe dots of frosting along the side of the face, then pipe the mustache between the nose and lip, and add some swirls on top of the beard, if desired.\nAllow cupcake cake to sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature (or place in the fridge) to allow frosting to crust.

Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.\nPour yeast mixture and orange blossom water over the dough and mix until evenly moistened. Pinch off a piece of dough and roll into a ball; it should hold its shape without cracking. Add more milk or orange blossom water if needed. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.\nSprinkle some flour over the ma'amoul molds and tap out the excess. Pinch off a walnut-sized piece of dough and roll into a ball. Press your thumb into the ball to create space for the filling. Work the edges with your fingers so the sides are even and fairly thin. Drop in a piece of date paste and pinch dough over it to seal.\nPlace cookie into the mold cavity seam-side up. Press down so that the top is flush with edges of the mold. Trim off any excess dough. Invert the mold and tap it against your work surface to release the cookie. Repeat with remaining dough and date paste, arranging cookies 1 inch apart on the baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven, 1 baking sheet at a time, until edges and bottoms are golden but tops are still mostly pale, about 15 minutes.\nSift powdered sugar over the cookies while still slightly warm.

      "instructions": "Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nMelt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until slightly brown, about 3 minutes. Whisk in milk; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Once boiling, reduce heat immediately and simmer for 5 minutes. Add 1/2 of the Gruyère cheese, salt, pepper, and nutmeg; heat until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.\nSpread about 1 teaspoon butter on 2 pieces of bread. Spread 1 tablespoon cheese sauce on top and layer each with a beef slice. Spread 1 teaspoon butter on the remaining 2 pieces of bread, then spread Dijon mustard on top and sprinkle with remaining Gruyère. Transfer all 4 pieces to a baking sheet.\nBroil in the preheated oven until cheese is almost melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oven, place toast slices together to make 2 sandwiches and pour remaining cheese sauce on top of each sandwich. Return to the broiler until sauce starts to brown, about 2 minutes.\nWhile the sandwiches are broiling, heat remaining butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Crack 2 eggs into the skillet, keeping them completely separate from one another. Season with salt and pepper. Add water, cover, and baste until whites are set but yolks are still runny, about 2 minutes.\nTop each sandwich with an egg and sprinkle with dill, if using. Serve immediately.",
